Tessalyn Ausra’s fate has always been out of her hands. Still bonded to the Heir of Endings, she now finds herself with more control than ever before. Everyone wants something from her, and she must choose a side. But in a realm full of villains, she trusts no one, and she has secrets of her own to keep.A plan to salvage.

But as myths become reality, he finds himself fighting more than time in an effort to keep what’s his or lose it all to fury.A fate to alter.

But with each passing day, he risks triggering a curse and endangering those he cares for most. He’ll sacrifice anything to keep them safe, even if that means giving up everything he is.Who will be left standing when Chaos comes to reign?",

  "bookDescription": "This #1 New York Times bestseller is a highly addicting enemies-to-lovers Romantasy with razor-sharp banter, heart-stopping action, and blistering hot romance. Do not touch the sword. Do not turn the key. Do not open the gate. Twenty-four-year-old Saeris Fane is good at keeping secrets. No one knows about the strange powers she possesses, or the fact that she has been picking pockets and stealing from the Undying Queen’s reservoirs for as long as she can remember. In the land of the unforgiving desert, there isn’t much a girl wouldn’t do for a glass of water. But a secret is like a knot. Sooner or later, it is bound to come undone. When Saeris comes face-to-face with Death himself, she inadvertently reopens a gateway between realms and is transported to a land of ice and snow. The Fae have always been the stuff of myth, of legend, of nightmares…but it turns out they’re real, and Saeris has landed right in the middle of a centuries-long conflict that might just get her killed. The first of her kind to tread the frozen mountains of Yvelia in over a thousand years, Saeris mistakenly binds herself to Kingfisher, a handsome Fae warrior, who has secrets and nefarious agendas of his own. He will use her Alchemist’s magic to protect his people, no matter what it costs him… or her. Death has a name. It is Kingfisher of the Ajun Gate. His past is murky. His attitude stinks. And he’s the only way Saeris is going to make it home. Be careful of the deals you make, dear child. The devil is in the details... Now with an embossed cover, silver foiling, and an updated interior design.  N.B. Quicksilver contains depictions of graphic violence/adult situations and is therefore recommended for readers 17+. For a full list of tropes and TWs, please visit the author's website.",

  "bookDescription": "Fourth Wing meets The Hunger Games in this spicy, page-turning romantasy where humans and direwolves forge unbreakable bonds and fight for survival at all costs.  Only the worthy survive the Bonding Trials.  She’ll risk her life—and her heart—to be one of them.    Meryn Cooper has always hated the Bonded, elite warriors who form mental links with the massive, vicious direwolves they ride. While they live in luxury, Meryn struggles to keep her family out of poverty. When her little sister, Saela, is kidnapped—stolen across the border by the immortal monsters her country has spent centuries fighting—Meryn’s world falls apart.   Desperate to cross the front and save her sister, Meryn enlists in the army and is thrown into the deadly Bonding Trials, where any mistake will cost her life.     Now Meryn must survive four months of training at the castle. She is bound to a feral direwolf who refuses to communicate. The other trainees would love to spill her common blood. And her cold and beautiful instructor, Stark Therion, is eager to punish any weakness.   Everything is a competition, and everyone is out to get her—everyone except the dangerously handsome crown prince, whose attention adds another target to her back. In the castle, every smile hides a knife…and the halls hide dark secrets.   It’s bond or bleed. Duel or die. Failure is ruin.  Dire Bound contains mature content including depictions of graphic violence, and is therefore recommended for readers 17+. For a full list of tropes and TWs, please visit the author's website.   Readers are already falling in love with Direbound: “ONE OF THE BEST READS OF THE YEAR!

You need to read it IMMEDIATELY.” Goodreads reviewer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “If you’re into dark romantasy with high stakes, fierce characters, and just the right amount of emotional wreckage, Direbound is your next obsession.” Goodreads reviewer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “What an incredible read!! … I am blown away. … The romance, the anguish, the BANTER! I love a book with good banter and this was FULL OF IT!” Goodreads reviewer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “I. Am. OBSESSED. … Left me spiraling in the best way possible. The morally grey anti-hero? Perfection. The slow-burn tension? Electric. … I was completely immersed.” Goodreads reviewer ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Perfect for fans of: Slow burn romance  Found family  Morally grey characters  One bed  Touch her and die  Who did this to you  Enemies to lovers  Forced proximity  Vampires vs. wolves!\nSlow burn romance\nSlow burn romance\nFound family\nFound family\nMorally grey characters\nMorally grey characters\nOne bed\nOne bed\nTouch her and die\nTouch her and die\nWho did this to you\nWho did this to you\nEnemies to lovers\nEnemies to lovers\nForced proximity\nForced proximity\nVampires vs. wolves!\nVampires vs. wolves!",

  "bookDescription": "Only the greatest sacrifice can turn the tide of war.War is brewing in the fifth book of the #1 bestselling Throne of Glass series by Sarah J. Maas.The long path to the throne has only just begun for Aelin Galathynius as war looms on the horizon. Loyalties have been broken and bought, friends have been lost and gained, and those who possess magic find themselves increasingly at odds with those who don't.With her heart sworn to the warrior-prince by her side and her fealty pledged to the people she is determined to save, Aelin will delve into the depths of her power to protect those she loves. But as monsters emerge from the horrors of the past, dark forces stand poised to claim her world. The only chance for salvation lies in a desperate quest that may take more from Aelin than she has to give, a quest that forces her to choose what-and who-she's willing to sacrifice for the sake of peace.Kingdoms collide in this fifth book in the #1 New York Times bestselling Throne of Glass series.",

  "bookDescription": "Revenge demands the ultimate sacrifice. When twins Thais and Thatcher are thrust into the deadly Trials of Ascension, they'll navigate brutal competitions and forbidden desires, discovering some secrets are worth dying for—and others are worth killing for.In a world where divine power bleeds into the mortal realm, Thais Morvaren has mastered the art of deception. To her seaside village, she's just a fisherman's daughter, serving oysters to summer tourists. In secret, she hides her ability to forge weapons from starlight—a power that would force her into the deadly Trials of Ascension.But when a priest's ritual exposes her divine heritage, Thais is seized and conscripted into the trials against her will. Now trapped in a competition she never wanted to enter, she transforms her fear into purpose: to kill Olinthar, King of the Gods—the father whose divine touch proved fatal to her mother.To take down a god, she must become one, even if it costs her everything.Worse still, the selection ceremony binds her to a mentor: Xül. A necromancer prince with blood-soaked hands, a sharp tongue, and dark secrets of his own. From the moment they meet, sparks fly. He's insufferably arrogant, she's stubborn to the bone, and neither has any intention of yielding to the other... or to the heat between them.Each trial survived brings her closer to godhood, but beneath the spectacle of competition, something ancient and malevolent stalks the shadows of the divine realm—a darkness that threatens to unravel the heavens themselves.Thais may have been forced into the Trials seeking survival, but she'll finish them seeking vengeance.And the cost of godhood is rising.Because some stars aren't meant to be weapons.Some stars are meant to fall.",

  "bookDescription": "A tea leaf reader in nineteenth-century England falls in love—and in danger—with a reclusive alchemist in an enthralling historical fantasy by the author of Salt & Broom and Grimm Curiosities.\nCornwall, 1854. The people of Roche have always whispered about the recluse in the black granite tower that looms above the moorland. But one young woman is driven to discover the truth behind the old tales.\nHer life overshadowed by family tragedy, Mina Penrose escapes her lonely days by working at The Magpie, a cozy tearoom on the village’s edge. Lately she’s been seeing shapes in the sodden leaves that hint at the future. After one such omen, Mina stumbles upon a murdered man on the heath. Villagers immediately suspect Harker Tregarrick, a living, breathing mystery who never ventures beyond the bounds of his centuries-old estate.\nUntil the day after the murder, when the handsome and compelling recluse visits The Magpie…leading to a meeting that will change both their fates. Captivated by a man around whom danger and rumors of death swirl, Mina has never felt more alive. Can she uncover Harker’s heartbreaking history—and the truth about the murder—before tragedy strikes again?",

  "bookDescription": "From the author of Nocticadia comes a spellbinding gothic dark fantasy about a shunned woman who is forced beyond the mortal realm's forbidden boundary, into a terrifying world of cursed souls and grotesque creatures.\nOnly the banished know what lies beyond the woods ...\nThere are whispers about what lurks in Witch Knell—the forest where sinners go to die. The villagers call it The Eating Woods because what’s taken is never given back. Only those who’ve lost their senses would dare to go near it.\nOr the banished.\nMaevyth Bronwick knows better than to breach the misty labyrinth of trees, but a tragic turn of events compels her beyond the archway of bones, to a boundary no mortal has crossed before. One that cloaks a dark and fantastical world that’s as dangerous as it is alluring.\nIt’s there that he dwells, the cursed lord of Eidolon. The one tasked to keep her hidden from the magehood that seeks to crucify her in the name of an arcane prophesy. Zevander Rydainn, known to his prey as The Scorpion, is the coldest, most calculated assassin in all of Aethyria and he’d sooner toss his feisty ward to a pack of vicious fyredrakes than keep her safe.\nIf only he could.\nMaevyth’s blood is the key to breaking his despised curse and vanquishing the slumbering evil in Witch Knell. Unfortunately for Lord Rydainn, fate has other plans for the irresistible little enchantress. And his growing obsession with her threatens to destroy everything.\nIncluding himself.\nAnathema is a full-length, gothic dark fantasy, the first book in The Eating Woods duology. Perfect for readers who enjoy a plot-heavy and atmospheric story with a unique magic system, a slow-burn romance and a touch of horror.",

But darker forces are rising. . .Aurora may have survived the Wolf King, but his bite marks her skin. In accordance with wolf law, that makes her his property. Now, he wants her back.\nTo beat him and take his throne, Aurora and Callum must form a dangerous alliance with one of the most feared Wolves in the Kingdom, Blake. He is their enemy, but he has entangled his life with Aurora’s—meaning she cannot harm him without forfeiting her own life.\nAs she fights to break their connection, she suspects Blake is keeping secrets about a dark power that rises in the north, and the unsettling nature of the bond between them. It seems there is a bigger game at play than who sits on the Wolf Throne—one that threatens both the Kingdom of Wolves, and the Kingdom of Men.\nWith her wolf awakening, enemies closing in, relationships tested, and secrets revealed—Aurora may be the only one who can stop an ancient evil from rising.\nIf she can figure out who to trust.\nIf she can figure out where she, and her heart, belong.\nIf she can stay alive.The highly anticipated sequel to The Wolf King. A romantasy for fans of enemies to lovers, shifters, forbidden romance, villains you love to hate (or maybe just love!), and werewolves. Contains strong language and sexual situations.",

And even though I don’t leave the confines of the palace, I’m safe.Until war comes to the kingdom and a deal is struck.Suddenly, my trust is broken. My love is challenged, and I realize that everything I thought I knew about Midas might be wrong.Because these bars I’m kept in, no matter how gilded, are still just a cage.But the monsters on the other side might make me wish I’d never left.The myth of King Midas reimagined.

  "bookDescription": "In the world of the shifter elite, a safe female is one without power. For me, that means hide or die.\nWhen wraiths invade my neighborhood and shit goes sideways, becoming a Guardian might be the only way to earn myself—and my beast—protection.\nThe elite training program begins at the local shifter college, so I pack up my swords and my brother, and off to school I go.\nIt’s no surprise that Guardian training is sexist as hell. But I didn’t expect to be trapped inside the campus walls, battling magical simulations rather than joining the real forces as they wage war on the monsters outside.\nFor me, the stakes are higher than bragging rights and points on the leaderboard.\nI won’t be distracted, especially not by the pull I feel to the most powerful quad of males in the program.\nHeath Blackwell, the dominant Alpha wolf and quad leader;\nWyatt Gale, the cocky playboy bear shifter;\nAiden Blackwell, the uptight jaguar who’s also my professor;\nAnd Elijah Harrow, the terrifying yet entrancing basilisk.\nI’ll fight this infuriating attraction because I know the score. Powerful quads want a central bond, and that will never be my future.\nBecome a Guardian. Stay alive. Nothing else matters.\nThis is a paranormal romance set at a supernatural college in present-day USA. It is a “why choose” romance, which means our heroine will have multiple love interests and will get her happily ever after with ALL of them by the end of the series. This is book 1 of 3, and it will end in a cliffhanger. It is intended for readers aged 18+ and contains foul language and spicy scenes. Detailed content warnings can be found in the Author’s Note. Happy reading!",

Maas.Chaol Westfall and Nesryn Faliq have arrived in the shining city of Antica to forge an alliance with the Khagan of the Southern Continent, whose vast armies are Erilea's last hope. But they have also come to Antica for another purpose: to seek healing at the famed Torre Cesme for the wounds Chaol received in Rifthold.After enduring unspeakable horrors as a child at the hands of Adarlanian soldiers, Yrene Towers has no desire to help the young lord from Adarlan, let alone heal him. Yet she has sworn an oath to assist those in need, and she will honor it. But Lord Westfall carries his own dark past, and Yrene soon realizes that those shadows could engulf them both.Chaol, Nesryn, and Yrene will have to draw on every scrap of their resilience to overcome the danger that surrounds them. But while they become entangled in the political webs of the khaganate, long-awaited answers slumber deep in the mountains, where warriors soar on legendary ruks. Answers that might offer their world a chance at survival . . . or doom them all.The final battle looms in this sixth book in the #1 New York Times bestselling Throne of Glass series.",

When her former lover comes sniffing at her door, demanding she take her place back in his bed or lose her sanctuary, Brigid knows it would break more than her heart to agree.\nThere's only one person powerful enough to keep her out of another man's reach.\nA new alpha has risen.\nWith the death of his father, it’s time for Torion to step into his rightful place, as Alpha of Grave Hills. Young, determined to do better for his home and his people, Torion needs to focus on the work ahead of him. What he should not do, is anger a respected beta by stealing away his omega.\nIt would be an even bigger mistake to fall in love with her, when his heart is the last thing she wants.",

  "bookDescription": "From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of A Discovery of Witches and The Black Bird Oracle comes a novel about what it takes to become a vampire—the fourth in the All Souls series.Look for the hit series “A Discovery of Witches,” now streaming on AMC+, Sundance Now, and Shudder! On the battlefields of the American Revolution, Matthew de Clermont meets Marcus MacNeil, a young surgeon from Massachusetts, during a moment of political awakening when it seems that the world is on the brink of a brighter future. When Matthew offers him a chance at immortality and a new life free from the restraints of his puritanical upbringing, Marcus seizes the opportunity to become a vampire. But his transformation is not an easy one and the ancient traditions and responsibilities of the de Clermont family clash with Marcus's deeply held beliefs in liberty, equality, and brotherhood. Fast-forward to contemporary Paris, where Phoebe Taylor--the young employee at Sotheby's whom Marcus has fallen for--is about to embark on her own journey to immortality. Though the modernized version of the process at first seems uncomplicated, the couple discovers that the challenges facing a human who wishes to be a vampire are no less formidable than they were in the eighteenth century. The shadows that Marcus believed he'd escaped centuries ago may return to haunt them both--forever. A passionate love story and a fascinating exploration of the power of tradition and the possibilities not just for change but for revolution, Time's Convert, the fourth books in the All Souls Series channels the supernatural world-building and slow-burning romance that made the previous books instant bestsellers to illuminate a new and vital moment in history, and a love affair that will bridge centuries.",

  "bookDescription": "A masterpiece in fated mates and broken bonds world-building for fans of Sarah J. Maas, Amber V. Nicole, Kaylie Smith, and Rebecca Yarros, the first installment in Melissa K. Roehrich’s internationally bestselling Legacy Series is a contemporary dark romantasy set in a world forgotten by the gods, created for their descendants, roamed by dragons, served by Fae…and not so different from our own.“No one writes emotional, immersive, beautiful chaos like Melissa Roehrich. If you love worlds you can practically touch and taste, angst that will have your heart pounding, and romance that will leave you breathless, Rain of Shadows and Endings will consume you from the beginning!” —LJ Andrews, bestselling author of The Ever Seas and Broken Souls and BonesOut of all their creations, the gods favored their children the most. But with that favor came the fear that their Legacy would one day become too powerful . . .A World the Gods Forgot Devram is a realm hidden amongst the stars. The gods gave their Legacy the best of all the worlds, and then they left—having sworn to never return and to never interfere.A Historical Event Forced into a life of servitude, the Fae provide for the Legacy in more ways than one. Every five years, eligible Fae are gathered for the Selection and assigned to serve in one of the six Kingdoms. To be chosen as the personal Source for a Kingdom Heir is the greatest honor, and for the first time in millennia, all six Kingdoms have heirs choosing a Source. But their selections could tip the power balance a little too far.A Chosen That Was Never Meant to Be Tessalyn Asura was as forgotten as the realm. But when she finds herself the personal Source to the Heir of Endings, she winds up serving in the darkest Kingdom of them all. The secrets within the Arius Kingdom are meant to be learned and kept, but this was never the life she wanted. Fighting not only the fate thrust upon her, but the temptation to lose herself to desire, Tessa will do anything to escape her new destiny. Until she begins to realize that maybe their world isn’t as forgotten as they thought—and that maybe she’s the reason why.",

  "bookDescription": "The seductive and stunning #1 New York Times bestselling sequel to Sarah J. Maas's spellbinding A Court of Thorns and Roses.Feyre has undergone more trials than one human woman can carry in her heart. Though she's now been granted the powers and lifespan of the High Fae, she is haunted by her time Under the Mountain and the terrible deeds she performed to save the lives of Tamlin and his people.As her marriage to Tamlin approaches, Feyre's hollowness and nightmares consume her. She finds herself split into two different people: one who upholds her bargain with Rhysand, High Lord of the feared Night Court, and one who lives out her life in the Spring Court with Tamlin. While Feyre navigates a dark web of politics, passion, and dazzling power, a greater evil looms. She might just be the key to stopping it, but only if she can harness her harrowing gifts, heal her fractured soul, and decide how she wishes to shape her future-and the future of a world in turmoil.Bestselling author Sarah J. Maas's masterful storytelling brings this second book in her dazzling, sexy, action-packed series to new heights.",

  "bookDescription": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER\nThe #1 internationally bestselling phenomenon, When the Moon Hatched, is a fast-paced fantasy romance featuring an immersive, vibrant world with mysterious creatures, a unique magic system, and a love that blazes through the ages.\nThe Creators did not expect their beloved dragons to sail skyward upon their end. To curl into balls just beyond gravity’s grip, littering the sky with tombstones. With moons. They certainly did not expect them to FALL.\nAs an assassin for the rebellion group Fíur du Ath, Raeve’s job is to complete orders and never get caught. When a rival bounty hunter turns her world upside down, blood spills, hearts break, and Raeve finds herself imprisoned by the Guild of Nobles—a group of powerful fae who turn her into a political statement.\nCrushed by the loss of his great love, Kaan Vaegor took the head of a king and donned his melted crown. Now on a tireless quest to quell the never-ebbing ache in his chest, he is lured by a clue into the capitol’s high-security prison where he stumbles upon the imprisoned Raeve …\nEchoes of the past race between them.\nThere’s more to their story than meets the eye, but some truths are too poisonous to swallow.\n\"A wild ride that thrills as much as it enchants . . . This remarkable book is an instant classic.” — Thea Guanzon, New York Times bestselling author of The Hurricane Wars\n“When The Moon Hatched breathes new, beautiful life into the genre, as Sarah A. Parker weaves lyrical prose with undeniable chemistry. I laughed, I cried, I got everything out of this. It’s an absolutely stunning fantasy world that everyone should sink their teeth into.” — Raven Kennedy, internationally bestselling author of The Plated Prisoner series",

No, there’s something that’s bloomed from the pit of my repression. Something dark. Something angry.But the last thing I expected was for my anger to call out to him. King Ravinger.He’s sinister and powerful and entirely too seductive. I’ve learned my lesson with trusting manipulative kings, so why does my chest constrict every time he’s near?

But one night changed everything.Now I’m here, a prisoner of Fourth Kingdom’s army, and I’m not sure if I’m going to make it out of this in one piece. They’re marching to battle, and I’m the bargaining chip that will either douse the fire or spark a war. At the heart of my fear, my worry, there’s him—Commander Rip.Known for his brutality on the battlefield, his viciousness is unsurpassed. But I know the truth about what he is.Fae.The betrayers. The murderers. The ones who nearly destroyed Orea, wiping out Seventh Kingdom in the process. Rip has power sizzling beneath this skin and glinting spikes down his spine. But his eyes—his eyes are the most compelling of all.When he turns those black eyes on me, I feel captive for an entirely different reason. I may be out of my cage, but I’m not free, not even close.In the game of kings and armies, I’m the gilded pawn. The question is, can I out maneuver them?This is the captivating second book of The Plated Prisoner series. It’s an adult epic fantasy story blending romance, intrigue, and beautiful imagery.

  "bookDescription": "Amazon.com and Wall Street Journal #1 bestselling dark fantasy romance series from authors Caroline Peckham & Susanne Valenti - a Booktok sensation!I’m a Gemini. Impulsive. Curious. Headstrong. A twin. Heir to a throne I know nothing about. And it turns out, I’m Fae.\nBut of course there’s a catch - all I have to do to claim my birth right is prove that I’m the most powerful supernatural in the whole of Solaria. And sure, technically that’s true as I’m the daughter of the Savage King. But the bit they didn’t put in the brochure was that every single Fae in this Kingdom would claim my throne if they could.\nThe school they’ve sent me to is both dangerous as sh*t and one helluva party. Vampires bite weaker students in the corridors, the Werewolf pack has orgies in the Wailing Wood at every full moon and don’t even get me started on the dark and twisted ways the Sirens use their powers on people’s emotions, or how my sinfully tempting Cardinal Magic teacher hosts detentions that leave people needing therapy.\nClasses are totally interesting if you manage to live through them. And that Gemini star sign I mentioned? It now determines my elemental magic and affects my destiny, so learning astrology is essential if I’m going to beat down my classmates – which is actively encouraged by the way.\nMy biggest problem is the drool worthy Dragon shifter who has his eyes on my throne. He and his three psycho friends are determined to make my time here hell.\nAll I’ve got to do is survive. But fate might have other ideas.\nDammit, why couldn’t I have gotten a letter to Hogwarts?\n***This is a enemies to lovers romantasy – don’t go expecting a sweet school for magic with friends around every corner. Fae fight for everything they own and Zodiac Academy is a cutthroat school for students aged 18+ where only the strongest prevail. There’s no Dumbledore here to save anyone’s ass and Lionel Acrux will give Voldemort a run for his money in the evil dictator category. So hold onto your stardust (broomsticks not required) and get ready for a bumpy ride***",

Maas and Rebecca Yarros—where enemies become lovers, monsters stalk a cursed realm, and a forgotten princess finds the strength to tear off her crown and become the warrior she was never meant to be.The gods sent monsters to the five kingdoms to remind mortals they must kneel.I’ve spent my life kneeling—to their will and to my father's. As a princess, my only duty is to wear the crown and obey the king.I was never meant to rule. Never meant to fight. And I was never supposed to be the daughter who sealed an ancient treaty with her own blood.But that changed the fateful day I stepped into my father’s throne room. The day a legendary monster hunter sailed to our shores. The day a prince ruined my life.Now I’m crossing treacherous lands beside a warrior who despises me as much as I despise him—bound to a future I didn’t choose and a husband I barely know.Everyone wants me to be something I’m not—a queen, a spy, a sacrifice.But what if I refused the role chosen for me? What if I made my own rules? What if there’s power in being underestimated?And what if—for the first time—I reached for it?The Shield of Sparrows series is best enjoyed in order.Reading Order:Book #1 Shield of SparrowsBook #2 Rites of the Starling",

  "bookDescription": "From internet sensation Lindsay Straube comes the first in a searing romantasy series where survival demands submission, and desire is the most dangerous game of all.\nTemperance Verus has never been kissed—not exactly ideal for a girl competing in the palace's most closely watched matchmaking ritual. Every year, a select group is invited to bond with the realm's magical basilisks and train in the art of charm, poise, and influence. The prize? A chance to win the prince's favor—and a life of privilege.\nTem expects rules, gowns, and etiquette.\nShe doesn't expect her assigned partner to be Caspen—the Serpent King, commanding, mysterious, and anything but safe. As he pushes her to unlock the strength she never knew she had, Tem finds herself drawn into something deeper, stranger, and far more powerful than royal approval.\nBut not all bonds are built for the court, and some secrets are meant to break them.\nReaders call it \"feral, spicy, and unforgettably bold.\" For fans of morally grey monsters, slow-burn fantasy romance, and stories that subvert the fairytale script.",

  "bookDescription": "Sarah J. Maas's sexy, richly imagined series continues with the journey of Feyre's fiery sister, Nesta. Nesta Archeron has always been prickly-proud, swift to anger, and slow to forgive. And ever since being forced into the Cauldron and becoming High Fae against her will, she's struggled to find a place for herself within the strange, deadly world she inhabits. Worse, she can't seem to move past the horrors of the war with Hybern and all she lost in it.The one person who ignites her temper more than any other is Cassian, the battle-scarred warrior whose position in Rhysand and Feyre's Night Court keeps him constantly in Nesta's orbit. But her temper isn't the only thing Cassian ignites. The fire between them is undeniable, and only burns hotter as they are forced into close quarters with each other.Meanwhile, the treacherous human queens who returned to the Continent during the last war have forged a dangerous new alliance, threatening the fragile peace that has settled over the realms. And the key to halting them might very well rely on Cassian and Nesta facing their haunting pasts.Against the sweeping backdrop of a world seared by war and plagued with uncertainty, Nesta and Cassian battle monsters from within and without as they search for acceptance-and healing-in each other's arms.",

This dark adult fantasy romance is inspired by the myth of King Midas and the gold-touched woman who realizes her true worth. \"I was nothing but a road to Midas. A means to get to where he wanted to go, and I paved that path in gold.\" My life has been made up of gilded lies. But death has been shaped from rot.Like a phoenix caught fire, I will need to rise from the ashes and learn to wield my own power. Because my wings may have been clipped, but I am not in a cage, and I'm finally free to fly from the frozen kingdoms I've been kept in.Yet the world doesn't want to let me.That's the thing when you turn against a king—everyone else turns against you.Good thing I have a different king in my corner.But even with the dark threat of Slade Ravinger, the other monarchs are coming for me.So I will fight for him and he will kill for me, and if we need to become the villains, then so be it.Because so long as I live in this world, I won't be used again.Please note: This is an adult fantasy series with dark elements that may be triggering, including past emotional and physical trauma, violence, adult language, and explicit romance.

  "bookDescription": "“I hope you guys love this book as much as I do!! (Let me just say...Hawk *swoon*!!)” ~ NYT bestseller Sarah J. MaasCaptivating and action-packed, From Blood and Ash is a sexy, addictive, and unexpected fantasy perfect for fans of Sarah J. Maas and Rebecca Yarros.\nA Maiden…\nChosen from birth to usher in a new era, Poppy’s life has never been her own. The life of the Maiden is solitary. Never to be touched. Never to be looked upon. Never to be spoken to. Never to experience pleasure. Waiting for the day of her Ascension, she would rather be with the guards, fighting back the evil that took her family, than preparing to be found worthy by the gods. But the choice has never been hers.\nA Duty…\nThe entire kingdom’s future rests on Poppy’s shoulders, something she’s not even quite sure she wants for herself. Because a Maiden has a heart. And a soul. And longing. And when Hawke, a golden-eyed guard honor bound to ensure her Ascension, enters her life, destiny and duty become tangled with desire and need. He incites her anger, makes her question everything she believes in, and tempts her with the forbidden.\nA Kingdom…\nForsaken by the gods and feared by mortals, a fallen kingdom is rising once more, determined to take back what they believe is theirs through violence and vengeance. And as the shadow of those cursed draws closer, the line between what is forbidden and what is right becomes blurred. Poppy is not only on the verge of losing her heart and being found unworthy by the gods, but also her life when every blood-soaked thread that holds her world together begins to unravel.\nReviews for From Blood and Ash:\n\"Dreamy, twisty, steamy escapism.

  "bookDescription": "In this sweeping romantic fantasy from bestselling author Jessica Khoury, a young witch caught in a twisted bargain with the fae must disguise herself as a governess and uncover the gateway to the realm of faerie in order to save her dying magic and escape the clutches of her controlling fae handler—even as she finds herself falling for her new employer, an enigmatic young Scottish laird and the owner of a crumbling estate brimming with secrets.\nRose Pryor has sacrificed everything for magic. As a Weaver skilled in the craft of spinning spells with thread and needle, she’s always chosen magic over love, and it was magic that brought her to Lachlan, the fae with whom Rose once struck a sinister deal in order to escape her abusive home. After years of running from her past, Rose has finally managed to build a new life for herself as a teacher in a school for young Weavers. But Rose has a secret: Her magic is waning, and every spell she weaves to train her students is slowly killing her.\nWhen Lachlan returns to collect the debt Rose owes him, she finds herself on a perilous journey to the Scottish moors where she must find him an ancient gateway to the realm of the fae, lest her precious magic be forfeit. But when her quest pits her against Conrad, a young laird with a soul as lonely as her own who hires Rose to work as a governess for his rebellious young sister, Rose finds herself torn between her promise to Lachlan and her budding feelings for her new employer as her search for the gateway puts both her magic and her heart at stake.",

  "bookDescription": "In the grimly captivating sequel to Anathema, Maevyth and Zevander must navigate the perilous mortal lands to deliver Zevander from the clutches of an ancient, malevolent power that threatens to shatter both worlds.\nIn the grimly captivating sequel to Anathema, Maevyth and Zevander must navigate the perilous mortal lands to deliver Zevander from the clutches of an ancient, malevolent power that threatens to shatter both worlds.An eldritch magic has awakened, turning the mortal world darker. Colder. Famished. With flesh-eating monsters and a sinister curse spreading like a plague, the last glimmer of humanity in Foxglove Parish has long-since faded.For Maevyth and Zevander, the only chance of escape is through The Eating Woods. But fate has woven a new web, tangling the threads of destiny, and crossing the mystical boundary to Aethyria might not be so simple.As the bones of Maevyth’s past are unearthed, and truths unravel with unsettling clarity, the possibility of never leaving Mortasia is becoming more of a reality. Unfortunately for Zevander, time is running out. The longer he stays in the mortal lands, deprived of essential vivicantem, the more he succumbs to the encroaching specter of madness.Or maybe those chasing shadows are someone hunting him. A wretched evil closing in, threatening to pull him into the darkest corners of his mind.Only, this time, Maevyth may not have the power to save him.Eldritch is a full-length, gothic dark fantasy, the second book in The Eating Woods trilogy. Perfect for readers who enjoy a character-driven and atmospheric story with a unique magic system, a slow-burn romance and a touch of horror.",

Armentrout returns with book one of the all-new, compelling Flesh and Fire series—set in the beloved Blood and Ash world.Born shrouded in the veil of the Primals, a Maiden as the Fates promised, Seraphena Mierel’s future has never been hers. Chosen before birth to uphold the desperate deal her ancestor struck to save his people, Sera must leave behind her life and offer herself to the Primal of Death as his Consort.However, Sera’s real destiny is the most closely guarded secret in all of Lasania—she’s not the well protected Maiden but an assassin with one mission—one target. Make the Primal of Death fall in love, become his weakness, and then…end him. If she fails, she dooms her kingdom to a slow demise at the hands of the Rot.Sera has always known what she is. Chosen. Consort. Assassin. Weapon. A specter never fully formed yet drenched in blood. A monster. Until him. Until the Primal of Death’s unexpected words and deeds chase away the darkness gathering inside her. And his seductive touch ignites a passion she’s never allowed herself to feel and cannot feel for him. But Sera has never had a choice. Either way, her life is forfeit—it always has been, as she has been forever touched by Life and Death.",

She knows what happens when a town turns against someone like her. But something about Loren Brae feels different. The land hums with old magic. The people watch her too closely. And the wounded fox at her side refuses to leave.\nLuch Carmichael recognizes power when he sees it. A doctor by trade, a guardian by blood, he knows Faelan isn’t just the new vet—she’s something more. But she keeps her secrets locked up tight, refusing to trust the very place meant to welcome her. And in Loren Brae, turning away from magic is never an option.\nThe loch is restless. The old ways are waking. And Faelan will have to decide—keep running, or stand and fight for the first place that’s ever felt like home.\n🔥 A slow-burn Scottish romantasy filled with folklore, found family, and a love that refuses to let go. 🔥",

  "bookDescription": "*The limited deluxe edition will include gorgeous printed edges*\nFrom internet sensation and USA Today bestseller Lindsay Straube comes the second book in the sexy, biting Split or Swallow series, featuring dangerous basilisks, competitive seduction, and a love triangle that could destroy kingdoms.\nTem never thought she'd fall in love.\nBut now she's caught between the Serpent King and the newly crowned human king…\nAnd the war that is brewing between the basilisks and the humans.\nTem led a simple life on the family chicken farm, but now, her eyes had been opened—to love, to lust, to the pull of power, gold, obligation, and the violence of greed and war.\nWhen Tem embraced her basilisk half and crested Leo, she thought she'd set him free. Though it nearly broke her, now he could find his first love again, and she could be happy with Caspen.\nBut love is complicated. As much as Tem embraces her serpent side, rules and loopholes keep her beholden to Leo…despite her marriage to Caspen.\nAnd as it becomes clearer that her decision may not be so simple, their desire continues to smolder…and if one tinder flickers into flame, it could set the entire kingdom on fire.",

Lies and deceit pull her in different directions, and she soon begins questioning who she can trust.\nCharlotte finds herself navigating alliances and broken promises with the strongest rulers of the realms, all while discovering who she is beyond just a purchased female.\nThis fantasy romance is book 2 of 5 in the ongoing The Female series.",

But what that means is the least of their concerns. For now.What was foreseen.The Blood Crown has fallen, but what has risen is a far greater danger than they’ve ever faced. From flesh and fire, the Great Conspirator has returned to the mortal realm, and he wants only one thing. They must stop the true Primal of Death before he regains his strength, and it won’t be easy. Even weakened, his influence is undeniable. His power, unthinkable.Has come to be.While the future of the realms rests upon them, they won’t stand alone. The gods have awakened—each harboring their own blood-soaked secrets. But they must navigate an unbalanced realm, where every choice—past and present—has the potential to not only undo everything they’ve fought for but also destroy the very bonds that have Joined them together.For the Harbinger and the Bringer of Death and Destruction has risen.",

  "bookDescription": "A complete dark, fantasy romance series from Amazon.com and Wall Street Journal #1 bestselling authors Caroline Peckham & Susanne Valenti What do a heartless Dragon Shifter, a cold-blooded Basilisk, an arrogant Lion Shifter and a brooding, tattooed Harpy have in common…? Me. Elise Callisto. Vampire. Angel of vengeance. And a girl on a mission to destroy one of them for murdering my brother. I just don’t know which one did it yet.When I interrogated/accidentally killed a Werewolf who was high on a new and dangerous drug called Killblaze, his final words painted a dark reality for me. The King of Aurora Academy killed my brother. The trouble is, there’s four kings at the academy and each of them have motive and bloodthirsty natures. Aurora Academy isn’t a place for the faint of heart. To put it lightly, my town is the cesspit of Solaria where the most cutthroat Fae in the kingdom reside. The school itself is divided by the two gangs who run this city. The Lunar Brotherhood and the Oscura Clan. And guess what? Two of the kings run the gangs at the academy, their hatred for each other so fierce I hear a day doesn’t go by without blood being spilled in the halls. I might be a petite, lilac-haired girl who looks like I couldn’t hurt a fly, but they haven’t been introduced to my fangs yet. And they don’t know why I’m really here. Or that I’ll do whatever it takes to bring down the Fae who took my flesh and blood from me. I don’t believe in fate, but I do know this… the King who killed my brother is a dead man walking. And I’m prepared to sacrifice my heart, body and soul to ensure I get my revenge. This is a gritty, college age, steamy series set in a world where Fae fight to take whatever they want. The heroin will end up with multiple love interests so you never have to pick a favourite alphahole. You can expect dark and hot romance, and a twisted murder mystery which will leave your head spinning and your heart racing. – this series is set in the same world as Zodiac Academy but is its own story and can be read independently.\nMe.\nElise Callisto.

  "bookDescription": "\"An instant romantasy classic!\" -- Katee Robert, New York Times bestselling author\nEnter a new world of romantic fantasy from award-winning author N.E. Davenport—a journey of powerful magic, enemies-to-lovers, and political intrigue—as a warrior-princess and a vengeful king from rival fae courts form a fierce alliance to take down a merciless despot.\nPrincess of the Aether Dominion, Kadeesha wants nothing to do with fae politics. She is a warrior, first and foremost, and believes her greatest strength is leading her squadron of elite winged serpent flyers to protect her homeland. But bound since infancy to be betrothed to the Hyperion High King, ruler of all Dominions, she has no choice but to do what men have chosen for her.\nRepulsed by the idea, she decides to spend one last night of freedom—in the arms of a dangerous stranger who takes her to sexual heights she’s never experienced before…but who is only using Kadeesha to set a trap for the High King.\nFor the High King and the kings of his six Dominions were responsible for the decimation of the Apollyon Court, and its new king, Malachi, wants his pounds of flesh.\nOn Kadeesha’s wedding day, Malachi and his special forces attack. Her father is killed, and Malachi wounds the High King, ultimately taking Kadeesha as hostage back to his land.\nBut she is no true hostage. The two form a pact: she will help lure the High King so Malachi can kill him once and for all, and he in turn will not harm Kadeesha or the Aether people. And as much as Kadeesha hates politics, she is now the Queen of her folk. Fae bonds are unbreakable…and so, perhaps, is the attraction Kadeesha and Malachi feel for each other. For even as they must publicly display their connection to provoke the High King’s jealousy, they struggle to resist the powerful allure between them in order to achieve their ultimate goals.",

  "bookDescription": "The stories were all wrong — Hook was never the villain.For two centuries, all of the Darling women have disappeared on their 18th birthday. Sometimes they’re gone for only a day, some a week or a month. But they always return broken.\nNow, on the afternoon of my 18th birthday, my mother is running around the house making sure all the windows are barred and the doors locked.\nBut it’s pointless.\nBecause when night falls, he comes for me. And this time, the Never King and the Lost Boys aren’t willing to let me go.\nNOTE: The Never King is a reimagining of Peter and Wendy. Characters have been aged up for this darker, grittier version. If you like your enemies to lovers romance with hot, ruthless, morally gray love interests, you’ll enjoy The Never King and the Lost Boys. You can expect hate kissing, fighting, bickering, and ‘touch her and I’ll unalive you’ vibes. Book one ends on a cliff.Please check the author's website for CWs.",

Samkiel, seeking to protect the woman he loves, sets out on a desperate search for answers, but the solution will mean a dangerous voyage to the one place he dares not go—the Otherworld.BUT WHO IS THE REAL MONSTER? It is a race against time as Nismera hunts for Vincent and Camilla, seeking what they stole. Her thirst for power and her armada only grow stronger as she rampages across the realms.

  "bookDescription": "Orphans. Changelings. Princesses. Queens.We are all and nothing now, our fate weighed on the scales of the stars and counterbalanced by the forces that oppose us.The shadow of the false king spreads as thick as oil across the kingdom we were born to rule, and none remain untouched by its darkness.Our crowns lay within reach if only we can claim them. All souls are at risk now and when the final battle dawns, a new regime will rise. The time for the true reckoning is upon us and we have proven ourselves as savage as our father, as brutal as our mother, and as wild as the Elements which roar through our veins. We can only hope it is enough.When the last sword strikes the final death in this game of fate and fortune, only one side will be victorious. The Starfall Legion charges at first light. And our destiny rides upon our shoulders as we rush into the end.All hail the True Queens. May our rule last longer than this night.***This is a dark fantasy romance – don’t go expecting a sweet school for magic with friends around every corner. Fae fight for everything they own and Zodiac Academy is a cutthroat school for students aged 18+ where only the strongest prevail. There’s no Dumbledore here to save anyone’s ass and Lionel Acrux will give Voldemort a run for his money in the evil dictator category. So hold onto your stardust (broomsticks not required) and get ready for a bumpy ride***",

Two worlds split and stitched together, with broken pieces from each, statues of fallen gods, and heavenly artifacts that are worshipped…or feared.\nBut nothing is more fearsome than the night.\nA strange madness haunts the darkest hours, turning innocents into gleeful killers. Arden does her best to stay safe, until she reads a book written about her life―The Book of Arden―and everything changes.\nForced to join Fort Bala Royal Academy, Arden is paired with the ruthless High Prince Cyrus Dolion. But while he trains her for combat against a mystical adversary, she can’t deny the sparks burning between them.\nIf her panic attacks and war games aren’t enough, Arden is also tapped to join the Tome Society, rumored guardians of an invisible library with books that foretell the future. But the more she learns about the society, the less she understands about Ourland, the gods…and the person she’s destined to be.",

  "bookDescription": "Flameborne is a slow-burn, mythical-world romantasy perfect for fans of Rebecca Yarros' Fourth Wing, and Sarah J. Maass's ACOTAR series—in which one broken woman and her dragon wage war with centuries-old tradition and the men who uphold it.They all expect her to fall. Only one man believes she can fly.Lowborn Bren never imagined she'd meet a dragonfury face-to-face. But when Ruin, her first love and a newly raised Furyknight, is sent on his first mission, Bren leaves the safety of her family's farm and stumbles through the night to surprise and farewell him. Instead, she discovers her lover's betrayal.Shamed, broken, and reeling, Bren climbs the Dragonmaw cliffs to end her life, only to be saved—and bonded—by a dragon.Now, as the first ever female Flameborne, Bren must earn her place among the Furyknights, a hallowed, all-male society of dragon riders. Her mere existence is the breach of centuries-old tradition. Yet, when the dragons embrace her, the men have no choice but to watch and wait for her to go up in flames.Her only willing ally is the fabled Battle Commander, Donavyn Arsen. Donavyn knows dragons don’t make mistakes. He agrees to train Bren in secret to prepare her for the Trials. But with so many hours alone, the pair’s mutual respect deepens into something more.Something forbidden.The #1 bestselling serial author, Aimee Lynn, ignites a fierce new world in which a broken young woman must find the strength to claim love—and a future no one believed she'd survive.Triggers and Tropes include: Romantasy with spice, dragons and dragon rider romance, fated mates, forbidden love, fantasy academy romance, touch her and die, forced proximity, weak-to-strong female lead, age gap, slow burn, and much, much more! *****Genre and Series info: This Emberquell Academy duet is a romantasy book for adults / romantasy with spice (though the first volume is slow burn.) These romantic dragon books are brimming with forbidden love storylines, \"Who did this to you?\" and a female lead who grows from weak to strong.",

Armentrout comes book four in her Blood and Ash series.From the desperation of golden crowns…Casteel Da’Neer knows all too well that very few are as cunning or vicious as the Blood Queen, but no one, not even him, could’ve prepared for the staggering revelations. The magnitude of what the Blood Queen has done is almost unthinkable.And born of mortal flesh…Nothing will stop Poppy from freeing her King and destroying everything the Blood Crown stands for. With the strength of the Primal of Life’s guards behind her, and the support of the wolven, Poppy must convince the Atlantian generals to make war her way—because there can be no retreat this time. Not if she has any hope of building a future where both kingdoms can reside in peace.A great primal power rises…Together, Poppy and Casteel must embrace traditions old and new to safeguard those they hold dear—to protect those who cannot defend themselves. But war is only the beginning. Ancient primal powers have already stirred, revealing the horror of what began eons ago. To end what the Blood Queen has begun, Poppy might have to become what she has been prophesied to be—what she fears the most.As the Harbinger of Death and Destruction.",

  "bookDescription": "The war has begun. Both sides demand Diem’s allegiance—or her death.After her disastrous coronation, Diem finds herself at the center of the conflict between the Descended and the Guardians. With her newfound friends and the man she’s falling for on one side, and the mortals she has vowed to protect on the other, Diem must walk a careful line to save the people she loves… even from each other.The mystery of her unusual heritage begins to unravel, sending Diem and Luther on an unexpected journey across the realms. The answers may hold the key to winning the war, but finding them will require her to face painful truths about her mother, her bloodline, and her fate.Meanwhile, the Crowns have set Diem in their sights. Some could be her greatest allies—while others want her dead. To end their oppressive reign, Diem must sort friend from foe and risk it all to build an army of her own.But a powerful figure in the north has plans that could change everything...Heat of the Everflame is the third book in The Kindred's Curse Saga, a four-book epic fantasy romance series that follows our fiesty, bad*ss heroine Diem Bellator in her fight against injustice, her struggle to survive in a royal palace full of betrayal and intrigue, and her journey of self-discovery and finding true love. This slow burn, enemies-to-lovers series is perfect for fans of unique magic systems, dragons and other mythical creatures, angst and romantic tension, and hilarious banter. This book will appeal to fans of plot-heavy, character-driven romantasy such as A Court of Thorns and Roses, Throne of Glass, From Blood and Ash, Gild, Shadow & Bone, and The Serpent & the Wings of Night.",

  "bookDescription": "From #1 New York Times bestselling author Jennifer L. Armentrout comes book two in her Flesh and Fire series…The only one who can save Sera now is the one she spent her life planning to kill.The truth about Sera’s plan is out, shattering the fragile trust forged between her and Nyktos. Surrounded by those distrustful of her, all Sera has is her duty. She will do anything to end Kolis, the false King of Gods, and his tyrannical rule of Iliseeum, thus stopping the threat he poses to the mortal realm.Nyktos has a plan, though, and as they work together, the last thing they need is the undeniable, scorching passion that continues to ignite between them. Sera cannot afford to fall for the tortured Primal, not when a life no longer bound to a destiny she never wanted is more attainable than ever. But memories of their shared pleasure and unrivaled desire are a siren’s call impossible to resist.And as Sera begins to realize that she wants to be more than a Consort in name only, the danger surrounding them intensifies. The attacks on the Shadowlands are increasing, and when Kolis summons them to Court, a whole new risk becomes apparent. The Primal power of Life is growing inside her, pushing her closer to the end of her Culling. And without Nyktos’s love—an emotion he’s incapable of feeling—she won’t survive her Ascension. That is if she even makes it to her Ascension and Kolis doesn’t get to her first. Because time is running out. For both her and the realms.",

  "bookDescription": "All stars must fall.Bloody, lost, broken. We live to fight another day. But with so much stolen from us, can the fates ever twist in our favour again?My sister and I have been torn apart by shadows and despair, and now we each stand alone.Our sorrow is spun like a web, trapping us tight, and I fear our enemies will soon come to feast upon our souls.But if I have my way, the merciless sky will have dealt us its final fortune. It’s time for us to take back the power that’s been ripped from our grasp and turn the tide of this war.All stars must fall, and all Phoenixes must rise.Long live the Savage Queens.***This is a dark, bully romance – don’t go expecting a sweet school for magic with friends around every corner. Fae fight for everything they own and Zodiac Academy is a cutthroat school for students aged 18+ where only the strongest prevail. There’s no Dumbledore here to save anyone’s ass and Lionel Acrux will give Voldemort a run for his money in the evil dictator category. So hold onto your stardust (broomsticks not required) and get ready for a bumpy ride***",

  "bookDescription": "From #1 New York Times bestselling author Jennifer L. Armentrout comes a new novel in her Blood and Ash series…Is Love Stronger Than Vengeance?A Betrayal…Everything Poppy has ever believed in is a lie, including the man she was falling in love with. Thrust among those who see her as a symbol of a monstrous kingdom, she barely knows who she is without the veil of the Maiden. But what she does know is that nothing is as dangerous to her as him. The Dark One. The Prince of Atlantia. He wants her to fight him, and that’s one order she’s more than happy to obey. He may have taken her, but he will never have her.A Choice….Casteel Da’Neer is known by many names and many faces. His lies are as seductive as his touch. His truths as sensual as his bite. Poppy knows better than to trust him. He needs her alive, healthy, and whole to achieve his goals. But he’s the only way for her to get what she wants—to find her brother Ian and see for herself if he has become a soulless Ascended. Working with Casteel instead of against him presents its own risks. He still tempts her with every breath, offering up all she’s ever wanted. Casteel has plans for her. Ones that could expose her to unimaginable pleasure and unfathomable pain. Plans that will force her to look beyond everything she thought she knew about herself—about him. Plans that could bind their lives together in unexpected ways that neither kingdom is prepared for. And she’s far too reckless, too hungry, to resist the temptation.A Secret…But unrest has grown in Atlantia as they await the return of their Prince. Whispers of war have become stronger, and Poppy is at the very heart of it all. The King wants to use her to send a message. The Descenters want her dead. The wolven are growing more unpredictable. And as her abilities to feel pain and emotion begin to grow and strengthen, the Atlantians start to fear her. Dark secrets are at play, ones steeped in the blood-drenched sins of two kingdoms that would do anything to keep the truth hidden. But when the earth begins to shake, and the skies start to bleed, it may already be too late.",

An ancient prophecy. A betrayal so deep it will echo through eternity.Ophelia Hart is no ordinary elementai. In fact, she is extraordinary in every single way there is.And now that she knows her true heritage and has bonded to the most powerful vampire who ever lived, and the three ruthless vampires he sired, she wonders if she might finally know some true happiness. It seems at last within her reach—so long as the truth of her identity remains a closely guarded secret.But secrets can’t remain so forever. Ophelia must learn to harness the magical abilities she’s awakened before the rest of the world discovers who she really is. And although her four bonded mates will do all in their power to protect her, there are forces at work that even they cannot fathom.Destiny beckons, but betrayal lurks just around the corner. And debts will be settled for oaths that are PROMISED IN BLOOD.Please note: Promised in Blood ends in a cliffhanger, but Book 3 in the trilogy will have the HEA you’re waiting for.",

  "bookDescription": "He helped destroy her family. Now he wants to protect her. Dare she trust him?\nFor generations, magical sky shields have defended the Garden Kingdom from dragons and their savage riders. Now, the shield protecting the capital has been sabotaged, the castle destroyed, and all except the youngest member of the royal family slain.\nA healer with a love for books, antiques, and avoiding family gatherings, Princess Syla never thought the future of the kingdom would rely upon her—or that assassins would be hunting her down. With only an aged bodyguard with bad knees to protect her, she’s in way over her head.\nThen he shows up.\nThe powerful and deadly dragon rider Captain Vorik claims to be from a faction that wants peace, not war, and who opposed the attack. Supposedly, he and his dragon ally were sent to protect Syla.\nWith threats coming from all directions, she has no choice but to accept his help, but she doesn’t trust him—or her attraction to him.\nWhy is he really there? To kill her? To spy on her? To seduce her?\nAll Syla knows for certain is that she must get the best of Vorik before he can get the best of her. Her kingdom and her life depend on it.\nWarning: Sky Shielder contains sex, violence, and arrogant and opinionated dragons.",

  "bookDescription": "I stepped into the Shadow Court to save my brother. I didn't expect to walk out as the bride of the monster who killed the man I loved.\nKaan is the ruthless Lord of Shadows—ancient, merciless, and terrifyingly beautiful. He murdered Aslan with a smile on his lips and my name on his tongue. Then he claimed me as payment for a blood debt.\nNow, I'm his wife in black silk and silver chains. Owned. Caged. Watched.\nAnd on our wedding night, he doesn't ask. He takes—my body, my breath, my resistance—until I break. His mouth. His rules. His shadows, wrapping around me like a noose.\nI swore I'd kill him. Instead, I'm moaning his name in the dark.\nBecause monsters like him don't make love. They unmake you. But Kaan doesn't want love. He wants devotion. He wants me to beg.\nAnd the worst part? I think I will.\nThis is a dark romantasy and the first book in the Kingdom of Shadow trilogy. Set in the same universe as the Kingdom of Light trilogy (Crown of Ashes and Desire Book 1)",

  "bookDescription": "An unexpected gift offers the power to change everything. Keeping it could cost Diem her life. The threat of war has arrived at Diem’s doorstep, along with a new discovery that could save her people. To use it, she must survive the next thirty days by forming a devil’s bargain with the people she hates most: the royal family of House Corbois.But as she dives into the world of the Descended elite, Diem quickly realizes good and evil aren’t as simple as they seem. Old prejudices are challenged, and new loyalties blur the line between friend and foe.Meanwhile, her mother is still missing, and the secrets she left behind can no longer be ignored—and neither can the Guardians and their demands. Caught between an old flame and a sizzling new spark, Diem must confront the truth about who she is and what she wants before time runs out.War is coming, and dangerous enemies wait on all sides.. but the most deadly battle Diem faces may be the one for her heart.Glow of the Everflame is the second book in The Kindred's Curse Saga, a four-book epic fantasy romance series that follows our fiesty, bad*ss heroine Diem Bellator in her fight against injustice and oppression, her struggle to survive in a royal palace full of betrayal and intrigue, and her journey of self-discovery and finding true love. This slow burn, enemies-to-lovers series is perfect for fans of unique magic systems, dragons and other mythical creatures, angst and romantic tension, and hilarious banter. This book will appeal to fans of plot-heavy, character-driven romantasy such as A Court of Thorns and Roses, Throne of Glass, From Blood and Ash, Gild, Shadow & Bone, and The Serpent & the Wings of Night.",

  "bookDescription": "From New York Times bestselling author Gena Showalter comes a hauntingly beautiful dystopian fantasy, where ancient powers rise and a fearless young woman must choose between the ruthless prince who tempts her heart—and a destiny that could cost her soul.\nWhen Arden Roosa returns to Fort Bala Royal Academy, nothing is as it was. No longer just a lady-in-training, she’s now the infamous girlfriend of High Prince Cyrus Dolion—and the woman who brought down a king. Her reward? Round-the-clock guards and the attention of a royal executioner with secrets. But Arden has secrets too. As a double agent slipping between worlds to decode forbidden prophecy, she knows what’s coming. Sleeping gods are stirring, and a war igniting. With only a spark, everyone will burn.\nBut nothing goes according to plan. Grueling trials consume her days, and dangerous questions stalk her nights. Worse, Cyrus—the fierce, unshakable warrior she might love—is unraveling, losing pieces of himself, becoming a stranger right before her eyes. Desperate to save him, Arden strikes a life-altering alliance…and everything spirals. Now the gods are no longer dreaming. They’re hunting. Time is running out, the end closer than anyone dares to admit. Unless Arden can stop what’s coming, Cyrus will open the door to true evil—and she’ll lose him forever.",

  "bookDescription": "She’s trapped in a magical prison. To break out, she’ll make a deal with the most dangerous prisoner of them all.\nSentenced for a crime she didn’t commit, Samara is bullied by guards and tormented by the screams of her fellow prisoners. She’s resigned herself to enduring her fifteen-year term… until she learns that the freedom she's been promised is the cruelest lie of all.\nNow she's faced with a choice: resign herself to dying in the cold walls of Castle Greymere, or do the unthinkable and escape. But no one leaves Greymere alive. So to break out of the prison? She’ll have to use one of the undead.\nRaphael is the worst kind of monster: a vampire with a thirst for blood, the mortal enemy of witches, the same breed that killed her mother. And most importantly, he’s unspeakably powerful, his supernatural strength tamed only by the enchanted cuffs forced on him.\nHe’s her only chance at a life outside the prison walls.\nThe deal is simple: Samara unlocks his shackles, and he'll help her escape. But although Raphael agreed to help her leave Greymere, he never promised to let her go…\nA Bargain So Bloody is the first book in an exciting new romantasy series, perfect for readers who love slow burn romance with morally grey heroes who fall first and hard and heroines who find their own strength.",

Tuli. Ten women. A deadly contest. Only one can win the Sun King's heart. Lor has endured twelve long years of torment under the Aurora King’s rule. Her only desire is to escape and pay him back for every moment of misery she's endured. When a surprise release finds her in the hands of the rival Sun King, Lor is thrust into the spotlight as she competes against nine other Tributes for the role of queen. If she wins his heart, she'll earn her freedom and finally get her revenge. But Lor doesn't belong in the Sun Queen Trials. Not only does she not understand why she was freed, she isn’t a citizen of the Sun King’s court. The other Tributes resent her presence and will stop at nothing to ensure Lor is removed from the competition, permanently. Now Lor must win, because if she loses, she dies. Or worse, she'll be returned to the evil—and now vengeful—Aurora King.",

Enlisting isn’t optional.And I’m falling for a man who wants me dead.I’m a wielder of hearts and summoner of corruption. Heir to nothing and born to a fool in the wrong damn month.But I’m also one of only two Fae in this divided land of hellions who might be starting to see through the lies we’ve swallowed for so long.In the year we turn twenty-one, conscripts from across the warring nations of air, fire, earth and water are sent to Never Keep – the only place in our besieged continent where our magic can be Awakened.But something is wrong inside Never Keep. Something which might extend far beyond the reaches of this desolate fortress. Within the gothic walls of this frigid castle in the snow, we’re left to hold our own against the brutal Fae from the opposing lands.The Reapers are merciless. The Royals are lying. The Werewolves run rampant and Vampires roam the wastelands in bloodthirsty covens. But even though death lurks in every shadow of the Keep, it’s the least of my worries.I’m delving into secrets the stars don’t want me uncovering, making alliances with Fae born to be my enemy, falling for a sinner while promising my heart to a different heathen and somewhere amid it all, I’m supposed to win a war.I thought the only thing I had to do was survive my magical instruction.Turns out, fate doesn’t favour the wicked.***This is an enemies to lovers romantasy series set in the same world as Zodiac Academy, but it's a dark and villainous tale of its own. You haven't met tainted souls like these before or enemies that hate each other as deeply as these characters do. Book 1 in the series will leave your heart raw and bloody. You'll be left gasping for breath and aching for more of the twisted Fae who lurk between the pages and they might just be irredeemable...******This is an enemies to lovers romantasy series set in the same world as Zodiac Academy, but it's a dark and villainous tale of its own.

It sent me running from the place I thought I would be safe, right into the path of untold enemies.But when my life is in danger, the wolves I thought I’d lost for good are the ones who come for me. And they’ll burn down the world to keep me safe—even if none of us trusts each other anymore.With every moment we’re forced together, every whispered apology and stolen touch, my resolve to keep them at a distance weakens. And when I realize just how much each of these men has come to mean to me, that resolve crumbles to dust.Only there are more secrets to uncover—all our pasts lurking in the shadows. And when the monsters emerge from the darkness, there’s no escaping them this time…**Book Two in the Wolves of Crescent Creek Series. If you haven't met the wolves yet, their story begins in Crescent Kingdom.**",
